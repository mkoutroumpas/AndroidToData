# AndroidToData
An educational app for connecting to cloud database instances such as SAP HANA MDC and utilizing them to create informative dashboards.

This project consists of two modules: DataAccess and UserInterfaceApp. 

DataAccess is a generalized connector to cloud databases; however, we focus on SAP HANA MDC Trial instances on this version. In future releases, connections to other cloud database systems will also be supported. 

UserInterfaceApp is a simple Android application that will interface to DataAccess and demonstrates several business intelligence-oriented functionalities such as dashboard creation, viewing and customization. It will also feature seamless offline functionality.

Currently, the back-end module (DataAccess) is being developed, with a 01.11.2017 target completion date for the first beta version.
